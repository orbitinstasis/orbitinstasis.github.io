Welcome to my blog. I don't expect any one to read this unless of course I do something widely regarded as interesting in my lifetime. 

This site is long overdue, the truth is I put it off for a long time as I have minimal interest in making websites. The reason for such a site was primarily focused on the desire to showcase [my projects](./../../projects) with an appropriate hub of personal contact details (hope no creepy-pastas make me regret this). 

Enter [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and with permission, the dissection of [Anthony's](http://anthony-zhang.me) site which has allowed me to get this site up and running *very* quickly. Jekyll, being 'blog aware' gave me the idea to turn half of the site into my very own blog where I can **finally** make notes and progress reports for my projects, this will allow me to jump back into a project without getting completely confused about its existing state at my return months down the line!

So, who am I? I am _Ben_, I've been tinkering with electronics since [my early teens](../../blog/console-modding) and have since gone on to specialise in the computer engineering field, primarily in embedded systems. Having said that I'm always trying to push myself to grow further towards the software side, though at times it is intimidating when some of my best friends are brilliant programmers seemingly leagues ahead of me. It's easy to forget others may feel the same when looking at your own set of skills. 

Back to the point, other than the obvious, this blog I expect will have random personal posts but primarily posts about **electronics** and **music**, being the two main interests in my life. 

I hope someone finds this useful, I'm always happy to hear from you if you have any questions. 

Hope to see you soon!
