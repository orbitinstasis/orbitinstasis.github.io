Home Page
=========

This is the source code for [ben-kazemi.me](http://ben-kazemi.me/), my personal web page and blog.

This website is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and intended to be hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Development
-----------

On Debian and Debian-derivatives, run the following to build the site and serve it locally on `http://localhost:4000`:

    sudo apt-get install jekyll
    jekyll serve

Note that GitHub Pages uses Jekyll 3, and earlier versions of Jekyll might not work correctly.
